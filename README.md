# **pixel-art-maker**

A simple pixel art creator.

## Note

This project was part of a training exercise by Udacity on Front-end Web Development.
I will try to keep the code up to date but is not guaranteed as it is not an active project.

## Install

No installation required. Just open on any browser.

## What it can do

* Colour wheel available
* Each pixel can have its own colour
* User can choose the size of the grid

## Dependencies

1. jQuery CDN
  * https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js

2. Font: Indie Flower
  * https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Indie+Flower

## Contributions

As the project was part of a class lesson, by Udacity, there is no contribution.
You can fork it and do change it as you see fit.

## Issues

* Some browsers don't support the HTML5 colour wheel. Users can still change 
the colour by manually typing their HEX value.
